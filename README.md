# Hello, fellow developers! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Craig Lobo, a computer science student at the University of Alberta with a passion for backend development and microsystems development. This README serves as an introduction to the projects and code you'll find here.

## About Me
I'm a curious and driven individual who loves to explore the fascinating world of computer science. Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at the University of Alberta, I am eager to learn and contribute to innovative projects in the field of backend and microsystems development.

## My Interests
- Backend Development: I enjoy working on the server-side of applications, building robust APIs, managing databases, and optimizing performance.
- Microsystems Development: Exploring the world of microsystems, I am intrigued by embedded systems, IoT devices, and their integration with larger systems.

## My Projects
Here are some of the key projects you'll find in this repository:

- **Vaccine Distribution Network**: A Visualization and thought experiment of distributing the vaccine globally using a Genetic Algorithm to get to every country in the world with a set number of planes from a single destination.

- **BearPaths**: A web application that was made for HackEd Beta (A Hackathon) to provide students with a way to get from one place on campus to another while making use of the pedway system to avoid the cold weather outside in Edmonton during the winter.

- **Candy Raiders**: This project was made for the NATHACKS 2022 hackathon and was created within a 64-hour time frame from Jul 29 â€“ Aug 3, 2022. Candy Raiders is a shoot 'em up game where players control a candy ship, try to eliminate as many candy monsters as possible, and change the state of the game based on how concentrated they are!

- **Personal Website and Blog**: It is a personal website and blog made using React and NodeJS. It has integration with the Notion API and allows me to edit and use Notion as a Content Management System.

- **Handwrite** - Take physical notes into the digital realm: It is a project made for HackEd (Hackathon) to allow users to convert handwritten notes into digitally typed documents that users can copy and edit from.

## Get in Touch

## Contributions
I welcome contributions to any of my projects. If you spot any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to create a pull request or open an issue.

## Looking Ahead
As I continue my journey as a computer science student and developer, I plan to expand my skills and explore new areas of interest. I'm excited about the future possibilities and the chance to make meaningful contributions to the tech community.

Thank you for stopping by and getting to know me a little better. Happy coding! ðŸš€
